<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows the creation of documents that contain programming code, equations, visualisation, and narrative test. Jupyter supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, Julia, R, and Scala. Code can be executed directly within Jupyter Notebook and is able to produce interactive output such as HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types.

This tutorial will go through the step on how to:
- Download and install Jupyter on Windows and Mac;
- Create your first Jupyter Notebook;
- Run and execute cells;
- Manage kernels;
- Format your notebook your Markdown; and
- Convert your notebooks to other formats such as Python, Markdown, etc.
